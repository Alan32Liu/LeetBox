# LeetBox
A box of the fastest and most succinct attempts on LeetCode


## Focus

Since this is my extracurricular activity, I will focus on the questions I am interested the most first:

1. Category: Algorithm
2. Difficulty: Medium


## Disclaimer

Although MOST of these solutions are based on my original idea, I don't claim the authorship of ALL the code. 

This is because this repo intends to provide a LootBox for anyone who is interested in finding the *best* way to solve questions on LeetCode, and food for thought to encourage discussion. Hence a **better solution** is always preferred over **my solution**.

For the same reason, anyone is more than welcome to:

1. Challenge the code here by providing a better one (faster, more succinct, illustrating or interesting)
2. Add your authorship to any existing/new file if you have sufficient proof.
