# LeetBox
A LootBox of the fastest and most succinct attempts on LeetCode

## Focus

As this is merely an extracurricular activity, I will be cherry-picking the intriguing questions:

1. Category: Algorithm
2. Difficulty: Medium-Hard

## Warning/Error/Formatting issues

The code here may trigger warnings/errors while running on your local machine, which is because, behind-the-scenes, LeetCode automatically:

1. imports packages (e.g. `collections`, `itertools`)
2. loads related data structures (e.g. `TreeNode`)

LeetCode also (strangely) adopts *camelStyle* for `Python3`, which is not recommended in [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/). Similarly, [type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) are not used either : (

However, I am not inclined to change these as this repo intends to provide solutions for LeetCode, hence should be consistent with it.


## Disclaimer

Although MOST of these solutions are mine, I don't claim the authorship of ALL the code. This repo intends to provide the *best* way to solve questions on LeetCode, and food for thought to anyone interested. A **better solution** is always preferred over **my solution**.

For the same reason, you are more than welcome to:

1. Challenge the existing solution by opening a pull request for a *better* one (faster, more succinct, illustrating or interesting)
2. Add authorship to any current/new solution.
