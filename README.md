# LeetBox
A LootBox of the fastest and most succinct attempts on LeetCode


## Language

All questions are attempted with `Python`

## Focus

Since this is my extracurricular activity, I will focus on the questions I am interested the most first:

1. Category: Algorithm
2. Difficulty: Medium

## Warning/Error/Formatting issues

The code here may trigger warnings/errors while running on your local machine, which is because, behind-the-scenes, LeetCode automatically:

1. imports packages (e.g. `collections`, `itertools`)
2. loads related data structures (e.g. `TreeNode`)

LeetCode also (strangely) adopts *camelStyle* for `Python3`, which is not recommended in [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/). Similarly, [type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) are not used either : (

However, I am not inclined to change these as this repo intends to provide solutions for LeetCode, hence should be consistent with it.


## Disclaimer

Although MOST of these solutions are based on my original idea, I don't claim the authorship of ALL the code. 

This is because this repo intends to provide a LootBox for anyone who is interested in finding the *best* way to solve questions on LeetCode, and food for thought to encourage discussion. Hence a **better solution** is always preferred over **my solution**.

For the same reason, anyone is more than welcome to:

1. Challenge the code here by providing a better one (faster, more succinct, illustrating or interesting)
2. Add your authorship to any existing/new solution if it is yours.
